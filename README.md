# dotfiles

My personal configuration files. I'm tired of setting everything up from scratch every time I reinstall my OS, so I'm putting my configuration files here. Also, thanks to GitHub Copilot for even correctly auto suggesting my complaints about setting up my OS everytime. 

## Installation
### Everything
```bash
make all
```

### zsh
```bash
make zsh
```

### git
```bash
make git
```
